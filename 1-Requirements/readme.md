# Hardware design tools-
 A multitude of tools are usedin the building of this model. The major hardware
components used to build this model are mentionedbelow.
    


* ## Rain sensor:- 

    Rain sensors are devices that areused to detect raindrops. These are electrically isolated and are available as printed circuit boards. The working of a rain sensor can be adequately compared to the working of a switch. When rain falls, the switch turns to off mode. Whenever rain falls, the circuit gets completed and thus the resistance varies. They usually have a zigzag pattern of conductive path for conducting the rain fall or water fall. This rain sensor module can be used as switch for detecting the rain fall and the usage is quite simple. This rain sensor unit contains of a rain board and control board. Rain falls on the rain board which is equipped with two LED lights. In which one is for indicating the power supply and another one is for indicating the rain fall. The second LED light on the control board will blink only when the rain drops collided with the rain board. Rain board is adjusted to make fall the rain drops on it. Whenever the rain drops fall on the rain board, the LED indicator will blink and
    sends the signal to the microcontroller regarding the intensity of the rain fall.

* ##  Servo Motor- 
   Servo Motor is an electrical component that moves or rotates an object with the help of electricity. It is an electrical component that has high precession and high accuracy. It has high rotation capacity and is preferred where he object has to be rotated at necessary angles. This is a kind of motor that run through a servo mechanism. Based on the source of power, the servo motor are of two types:
     * ###  DC powered servo motor
     * ### AC powered servo motor

   The servo motor used for the purpose of this project is highly efficient, light- weight and offers high force. These features are advantageous and hence these kinds of servo motors find application in development of toy cars, RC helicopters and planes etc. Servo motors are most commonly developed in kg/cm. The servo motors that are installed in automobiles for recreational purposes for kids are articulated in three models viz., 3kg/cm or 6kg/cm or 12kg/cm. This essentially means that the servo motor can be used in a device that weighs 6kg and the height of suspension of the weight is 1cm far from the shaftof the motor. Also, the bigger the gap the lesser
   the burden carrying capability becomes. An electric pulse determines the position of the servo motor and is placed beside the motor.


* ## Arduino Uno Microcontroller:-
    The Arduino UNO is nothing but the microcontroller based on the ATmega328. Arduino Uno contains 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analogy inputs along with 16MHz ceramic resonator, a connection for USB, a Power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It is designed in such a way that it supports the microcontroller. The connection can be set in two ways viz.,


   * With a computer by a USB
   * With the power with AC-to â€“DC adapter.

   A battery may be used for starting this. This is equipped with Atmega16U2 programmed as a USB to serial converters. This serial converter is the point of major difference between the Arduino and other FTDI USB-to-drive chip boards.
* ## STM32:-

   The STM32 is a family of microcontroller ICs based on the 32-bit RISC ARM Cortex-M33F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, and Cortex-M0 cores STMicroelectronics licenses the ARM Processor IP from ARM Holdings. The ARM core designs have numerous configurable options, and ST chooses the individual configuration to use for each design.

* ## Single Switch:-
   Crimp a single spade connector onto the end of each of the wiper motor wires. Connect the black wire from the motor to the fourth blade on the wiper switch terminal, which is the ground wire connection. Connect the white, red or green wire from the wiper motor to the second blade on the wiper switch terminal.Depending on the make and model of your vehicle, the windshield wiper switch will be located on either the turn signal indicator or a separate indicator level that is near your steering wheel.
