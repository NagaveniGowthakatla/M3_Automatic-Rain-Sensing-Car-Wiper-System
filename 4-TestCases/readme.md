## Brief Explanation:-
   Working Principle of the Automatic Rain Sensing Wiper Circuit Working of this circuit is same as the working principle of monostable multivibrator. Here the trigger to the second pin is given by rain sensors. A small water drop on the rain sensor will connect the negative voltage to the trigger pin  of  555 IC which  in turn  will turn  the output pin of 555 high. 555 Output is connected to the base of transistor through a 1K resistor which forward biases the transistor. Thus relay gets negative and it switches ON the wiper motor.The 12V DC supplies the power to the sensor as well as rain operated motor. Wiper motor is automatically ON during the time of rainfall. The senor is fixed in the vehicle glass. The rain (Touch) sensor is used in this project. It senses the rainfall and gives control signal to the control unit. The wiper sweeps the windshield with the help of a 4-bar linkage using a simple inversion. The motion of wiper is based on double crank mechanism whose working is quite similar to coupling rod of locomotive. The control unit activates the wiper motor automatically. This operation is called ―Automatic rain operated wiper System.

   ## Implementation The  following  measures must  be taken  into consideration  when using  the automatic  rain sensor car wiper:-


   * When the wiper switch is in the AUTO position, the wiper will operate for 1 cycle if the initial engine start is made. 
   * This may cause the wiper blades to wear prematurely. Therefore, other than rainy days, set the switch to the OFF position. 
   * Especially during the winter time, check if the wiper blades are not frozen to the windshield.  Operating  the  wiper with  the  blades  frozen can  damage  the  wiper motor.  
   * If  you operate  the  wipers when  the windshield is  dry without  spraying washer fluid,  the windshield  can be  scratched and  the wiper  blades can  wear prematurely.  
   * Use the wiper with the washer fluid when the windshield is dry.  When it does not rain, turn the wiper switch to the OFF position. 
   *  Turn the wiper switch to the OFF position before any car wash to avoid unwanted operation of the wipers.
