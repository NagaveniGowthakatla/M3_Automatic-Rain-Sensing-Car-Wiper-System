# Objectives:-

The rain sensor is placed over
the windshield and the servo motor powers the
wiper blades, which are directly connected to the
motor. When the signal is received, the arduino Uno
microcontroller is attached to all of the three
components, namely, the rain sensor, the servo
motor and the LCD. The microcontroller unit is placed
inside the car and is attached to a dc source; The LCD
is also in the car near the driver’s seat. It displays the
speed of the wiper blades along with the intensity of
the falling rain.

# Advantages:-

* car wiper able to clean the whole area of the windshield
* it can increase the safety of the car which can help the diver to drive safely because the whole area is cleaned. 
* 6.2.2 Economy When we look at the regular mechanism and bases of the car wiper , we can see that the car has two wiper, each wiper has a separate bases.
# Disadvantages:-

* The disadvantage is that the upper right corner of the windshield in the co driver's position can't be scraped, which may cause a blind area.
* They add to the total purchase of the vehicle. When broken, repairs can be expensive as only experts can fix the system.
* One of disadvantages is the sensitivity to external light.
# Apllications:-
* Windscreen wiper is a device that cleans water
* Snow or mud from the windscreen of vehicle
* It ensures proper visibility of the road ahead
* This system finds application on a large variety of locomotives from vehicles, railways to aero-planes.

# Conclusion:-
   The Conclusion is drawn in Section V. 5 6. DESIGN It was found that the rain sensor is the expensive unit in the present system and an effort is done in making a sensor which is reasonable by price, the Cup Sensor.
